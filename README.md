# Wayfinding-Project

This was designed for University of Toronto Scarborough Website to navigate the campus library using the floor plan and describing components of the floorplan through pop over images. I have used the Mapify plugin to get the pop over images.

**Tools used for the floorplan: Photoshop, Illustrator**

**Technologies used for Development: HTML, CSS and JavaScript**
